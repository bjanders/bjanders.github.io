Variable names:

* Use underscore, e.g. `partial_sum`
* Don't use names with all caps (they are reserved for macros)
* Use an initial capital letter for types (e.g. Square and Graph)
* Don't use variable names starting with an underscore, e.g., for member variables

Declaration:

* Use `int* p` (not `int *p`, which is fine in plain C)
